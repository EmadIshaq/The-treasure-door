Quantum Enigmas – The Treasure Door (Qiskit Implementation)
📌 About
This project is a practical implementation of the "Treasure Door" lesson from the IBM SkillsBuild Quantum Enigmas course.
I translated the theoretical circuit from the lesson into Qiskit code, simulated it with the AerSimulator, and visualized the results using Bloch spheres, Q-sphere, and measurement histograms.

🚀 Features
Build a quantum circuit step by step with 3 qubits

Apply quantum gates: Hadamard (H), CNOT (CX), X, SWAP

Visualize the statevector on Bloch sphere & Q-sphere

Simulate the circuit using Qiskit AerSimulator

Measure qubits and display probability distributions with histograms

🌟 Outcomes
Through this project, I was able to:

Convert theoretical quantum circuits into executable Qiskit code

Understand how quantum gates interact to create entanglement and interference

Visualize quantum states and interpret measurement results

Strengthen my skills in quantum simulation and circuit design

🖼️ Visualizations
This notebook generates:
