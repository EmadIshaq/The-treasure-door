# Quantum Enigmas – The Treasure Door (Qiskit Implementation)

## 📌 About  
This project is my practical implementation of the **"Treasure Door"** lesson from the [Quantum Enigmas](https://skillsbuild.org/) course on IBM SkillsBuild.  
I followed the video lesson and translated the quantum circuit into Qiskit code, simulating it with the `AerSimulator`, and visualizing results using Bloch spheres, Q-sphere, and measurement histograms.

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Build quantum circuits step by step using 3 qubits  
- Apply quantum gates: Hadamard (`H`), CNOT (`CX`), X, SWAP  
- Visualize the statevector and quantum states on Bloch sphere & Q-sphere  
- Simulate the circuit using Qiskit `AerSimulator`  
- Measure all qubits and show the probability distribution as a histogram  

---

## 🌟 Outcomes  
Through this project, I was able to:  
- Translate theoretical quantum circuits into executable Qiskit code  
- Understand how quantum gates interact to create entanglement and interference  
- Visualize quantum states and interpret measurement results  
- Strengthen my skills in quantum simulation and circuit design

## 🧠 Reflections  
This implementation helped me bridge the gap between abstract quantum concepts and practical experimentation.  
It’s part of my broader goal to build a portfolio of quantum projects that demonstrate both technical skill and learning progress.
