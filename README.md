# 🧑‍💻 Quantum Enigmas – The Treasure Door (Qiskit Implementation)

## 📌 About
This project is my practical implementation of the **"Treasure Door"** lesson from  
the **Quantum Enigmas** course on [IBM SkillsBuild](https://skillsbuild.org/).

I followed the video lesson and translated the quantum circuit into **Qiskit code**,  
simulating it with the **AerSimulator**, and visualizing results using Bloch spheres, Q-sphere,  
and measurement histograms.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Build quantum circuits step by step.
- Using 3 qubits.
- Apply **Hadamard (H)**, **CNOT (CX)**, **X**, **SWAP** gates.
- Visualize the **statevector** and **quantum states** on Bloch sphere & Q-sphere.
- Simulate the circuit using **Qiskit AerSimulator**.
- Measure all qubits and show the probability distribution as a histogram.

---

## 🌟 Outcomes
Through this project, I was able to:
- Translate theoretical quantum circuits into executable Qiskit code.
- Understand how quantum gates interact to create entanglement and interference.
- Visualize quantum states and interpret measurement results.
- Strengthen my skills in quantum simulation and circuit design.

## 🧠 Reflections
This implementation helped me bridge the gap between abstract quantum concepts and practical experimentation.  
It’s part of my broader goal to build a portfolio of quantum projects that demonstrate both technical skill and learning progress.

## 📖 Learning Source
This project is inspired by the **"Treasure Door"** lesson from the  
IBM SkillsBuild *Quantum Enigmas* program.  
I created the circuit in Qiskit as part of my learning journey.
